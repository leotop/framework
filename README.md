# Simple PHP MVC Framework

I've used the [Nova Framework](https://github.com/nova-framework) for an long time, to build simple and small web applications - but Nova is now to big. So i build a simple, easy and unsecure(?) solution for me. Without "true" autoloading, without special features. Just working for simple and easy web applications or apis.

### Install

Download the zip and just place the input any folder. Now go in the to config.php and set your variables and just start programming.

If you use the "Framework" in a subfolder just change the **RewriteBase** in your .htaccess File.

### Notes

Special thanks to Jack P. for the simple PHP Router [Nanite](https://github.com/nirix/nanite) and your, because you're reading my bad english! :)
