# Simple PHP MVC Framework

I've used the [Nova Framework](https://github.com/nova-framework) for an long time, to build simple and small web applications - but Nova is now to big. So i build a simple, easy and unsecure(?) solution for me. Without "true" autoloading, without special features. Just working for simple and easy web applications or apis.

### Install

Download the zip and place the input in any folder. Now set in your config.php all vars and just start programming.

If you use the "Framework" in a subfolder just change the **RewriteBase** in the .htaccess file.

### Notes

Special thanks to Jack P. for the simple PHP Router [Nanite](https://github.com/nirix/nanite) and your, because you're reading my bad english! :)
